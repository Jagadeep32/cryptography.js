## Contributing

Contributions to the **cryptography.js** library are very welcome! We can't do this alone.
You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:
- Make sure you properly unit test your changes.
- Before creating a pull request, run the unit tests to make sure they all pass.
- All the code (ciphers and deciphers) should be under `src` directory
- All the test should be under `test` directory. 
- Send pull requests to the `cipher` branch while implementing ciphers and `decipher` branch while implementing deciphers, not the `master` branch.

What can I do?

- Search through the [issues](https://github.com/vicky1999/cryptography.js/issues) looking
  for something that looks interesting to you to pick up. 
- issues for new ideas are very welcome.

Thanks!
